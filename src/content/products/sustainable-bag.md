Premium cotton is an intermediate solution for some classic **TWOTHIRDS** styles, because the fabric is extremely solid and durable. All the production stages (from yarn spinning to dyeing and tailoring) take place in small family-owned factories in northern Portugal, which we have a close relationship with.

A central quality aspect of our premium cotton is its fibre length - the longer the fibre the more stable the fabric. Single fibres have more contact with each other. The increased stability comes with an increased fibre strength, which has a decisive impact on the durability of the fabric. Therefore, the sustainability aspect of the premium cotton comes with a longer average use, which is why you have to buy new items less frequently - and hence, the environmental impact is smaller.

We are in the process of eliminating conventional cotton and instead use organic cotton wherever possible. Our long-term goal is to move away from cotton in general (organic or not) towards even more sustainable fibres.
